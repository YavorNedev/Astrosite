This is a project for an astronomy website where people can post, comment, discuss ideas, and upload photos of their experiences with the universe. It features forums (currently a work in progress with some bugs), a post list (which will eventually be renamed to "Gallery"), where users can upload images and post comments, custom user profiles, and a shop.
